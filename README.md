|-------------|-------------|
| [Compendium](https://compendium.ch/) | Swiss Drug Registry  |
| Other data | We also included data of the NHS |

## RAG Improvements

| Improvement                     | Description |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| `Query Expansion`          | Generate extra queries to expand search |
| `Query Rewriting`              | Rewrite queries to yield better result |
| `Result reranking` | Reranked the top 10 results with another model |

## Chunking

### Data Chunking Method

The data was chunked with the following logic to improve the performance of the RAG model:

| Type of Chunking  | Configuration |
|------------|---------------:|
| RecursiveCharacterTextsplitter      | 1000 characters, 100 overlap         |
| I also tried this method | x, y           |
| I also tried this one       | x, y           |
